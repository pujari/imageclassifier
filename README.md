## Machine learning for image classification

###Introduction
In the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry, product images are becoming popular in web based applications and planogramming tools. Use of  images and alternate views of products enhance user experience and are sometimes more intuitive than textual product descriptions. However it becomes cumbersome and expensive to manage, track and catalog millions of product images manually. The objective of this project is to test and compare various machine learning techniques to classify and label product images into product categories.  

###Tools
Python, Scikit Learn, sknn, Theano
